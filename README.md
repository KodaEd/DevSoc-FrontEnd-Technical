# DevSoc-FrontEnd-Technical

Technologies used
* React
* Tailwind
* react-router-dom

Things i want to highlight
* Reusable Components
* Custom Components (didnt use any ui libraries)
* Component Abstraction
* Project structure
* Nav Buttons Work to redirect to pages
* Implemented Dark Mode (dark mode of tailwind isnt working normally, so i had to manually pass it to children componentes, see my previous commit to see project without the implementation)
